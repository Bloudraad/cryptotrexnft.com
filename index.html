            Nifty Rodeo is all about fun. Think of us like an amusement park, except a virtual one.
            Roadmap 1.0, IDENTITY, consists of key activities designed to enhance your physical and digital identity in

            We have chosen to go into pixel art because while many see a pixel as just a dot, it represented a historic
            moment when mankind took a step towards digitalisation and computers and digital art started to gain
            relevance.
            This significant milestone by pixel art reminds us to continually hit milestones in our forage into the NFT
            space and the world.
