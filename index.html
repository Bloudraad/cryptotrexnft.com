            The Cryptotrex NFT was started seven months ago as a passion project, an awesome product of an individual
            with immense enthusiasm in technology, art and crypto. Our founder wanted to share his pixel t-rexes with
            the world. Seven months later, we are here. The CryptotrexNFT is ready to do some big things.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an owner of a Cryptotrex, you are in for a big treat.

            It is time to get things started with a bang! The magic formula for any NFT project is one that has a total
            supply of a set of recurring numbers. We will be designing 4 aesthetic animated Cryptorexes, and with that
            the Alpha Cryptotrex collection, comprising of 1,111 assets, form our genesis collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also be migrating to our own ERC-721 Smart Contract, and getting our official website up and
            running. The Cryptotrex now has its own home on the Internet and blockchain!

            Flexing a rolex was a thing of the past. Now itâ€™s time to flex your Cryptotrex merch! Weâ€™ll be releasing a
            line of products for you to show off your identity to the rest of the real world. As you walk around decked
            head to toe as a Cryptotrex (short of having a T-rex onesie, really) , those who donâ€™t know anything about
            NFTs will just think youâ€™re a dinosaur lover. But for those who know, iykyk :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay we know. Flexing in the real world is no longer cool, so weâ€™re going to be releasing the Cryptotrexels!
            (Short for Cryptotrex Voxel, duh). This basically serves as your avatar when you chill in the T-rex meta
            lair(s) we will be building. A total of 11,111 pieces will be created, and if you own one of the Alpha
            Collection, youâ€™ll be able to claim your Cryptotrexel for free. Or you can join the Cryptotrex family for
            0.08 ETH. Or both if you want to own more.

            Youâ€™ve got two dinosaurs, why not get an entire collection? We will be introducing the $FOSSIL token, which
            will have utility purposes such as building your dinosaur army in our game. Staking will be available as
            well. The possibilities (and fun) will be endless.

            The Cryptotrex project was started solely to share the love for pixel t-rexes with the world. But we want to
            do bigger things, larger than the T-rex. And the team here is dedicated to this mission.
